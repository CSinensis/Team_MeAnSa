GreenList is an app designed to raise awareness about the carbon footprint of your everyday grocery run. We aim to foster a sense of individual responsibility for mitigating climate change by allowing people to form 'groups' with their friends, view each others profiles, assign each other weekly challenges, and see detailed information on the carbon footprint of each ingredient they buy.
